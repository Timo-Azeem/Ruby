#For example, it can look like this:

'''Line 1: 3
Line 2: 7
Line 3: 2
(etc. etc.)'''

#DEBUG: Look at the following code:

puts first_number 

#Can you guess what error youâ€™ll get if you run the code? Now run the code yourself. What error message do you get?
#DEBUG: Look at the following code:

my_favorite_number = 9

both = my_favorite_number + your_favorite_number

puts both

#Fix the error by only changing line 3. The output should be 10.
