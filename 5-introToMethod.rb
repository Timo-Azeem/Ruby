#Use a method that changes the following string into all lowercase:

 puts "YUrI TOMoko".downcase

#What do you expect if you run the method “reverse” on

  puts  "spaceship".reverse
  puts "racecar".reverse
  puts 1776.to_s.reverse.to_i   #the method of reverse does not work to the numbers. (': undefined method `reverse' for 1776:Fixnum (NoMethodError)

#Test your theory and try it yourself.
#Fix the code to get the desired output - but this time do not add or eliminate any quotation marks:

puts 12 * 4					# should produce => 48
puts "3" + " times a day"	    # should produce => 3 times a day
